Upon conversing with my **wonderful** partner Freya, I learned that her favorite genre of literature is _fantasy fiction_.

### Her top three favorite books are:
1. Deathly Hallows
2. Return of the King
3. The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe

### Essentially, it is a toss-up between:

* ![Harry Potter] (https://www.scholastic.com/content5/media/products/21/9780545010221_mres.jpg)
* [Lord of the Rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings)
